Deep Learning and NLP:

  * Her movie - Practical example of DeepNLP

  * NLP can be applied in the following things:
    * Speech Transcription
    * Neural machine Translation (NMT)
    * Chatbots
    * Q&A
    * Text summarisation
    * Image Captioning
    * Video Captioning


  * Plan of Attack: 
    * Types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) , NLP vs DeepLearning vs DeepNLP
    * Classical vs Deep Learning models
    * End to End Deep Learning models
    * Bag of words NLP model (2 variations)
    * Seq2Seq (advanced of BOW, most important for our chatbot)
    * Seq2Seq Architecture
    * Beam search decoding (diff types of outputs that come up in chatbot)
    * Attention Mechanisms (additional augmentation of seq2seq model, longer term memory for the algorithm)
    *
    * Annex 1: Artifical neural networks (ANNs)
    * Annex 2: Recurrent Neural networks (RNNs)
    * ANNs and RNNs are the base for Seq2Seq architecture.

* Types of NLP:      NLP  DNLP//Seq2seq DL (Seq2Seq model is thope till date)


Classical vs Deep Learning Models: 

NLP Models: 
  * if/else rules module (chatbot): 
    - huge list of questions and answers that can be faced in chatbot
    - Gets mess over the time. 

  * Audio frequency components Analysis: 
    - Contains some predefined audio wave (recorded earlier from human voice)
    - When we talk in real time, it ll be looking out for the recorded libraries using mathematical calculations

  * Bag of words Model (words with 0's or 1's): 
    - Contains the statements with pass/fail value
    - When something comes, it ll look into the Bag of words and decide whether it is Pass/fail (0's or 1's) 

Deep NLP Models:
  * CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) for Text recognition: 
    - Is an Image recognition used in self driving cars to recognise the Obstacles
    - Interesting to see how it works for Text recognition

Seq 2 Seq Model: 
  - Used in Many applications
