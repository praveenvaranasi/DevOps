KUBERNETES is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications

* Planet Scale (billions of containers/week without increasing ops team)
* Never outgrow (flexibility grows with you to deliver your application consistently)
* Run anywhere (lets you to move your workloads where ever you need [on-prmises, hybrid, public infrastructure])

Features:

1. Service discovery & Load Balancing:
	* Kubernetes gives containers their own ip-addresses and DNS name for a set of containers
	* Also it can load-balance across the DNS (container set)

2. Storage Orchestration:
	* Automatically mount the storage system of our choice (local storage, aws, GCP or n/w storage system such as NFS, iSCSI, Gluster,
	  Ceph, Cinder or Flocker)

3. Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:
	* Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to our application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure
	  it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time
	* If Something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you.  

4. Batch Execution:
	* Kuberntes can manage our batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.

5. Automatic binpacking:
	* Automatically places containers based on the resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. 
	* Mixes critical and best effort workloads in order to drive up Utilization and save even more resources

6. Self healing:
	* Restarts Containers that fail, replaces & reschedules containers when nodes die
	* Kills Containers that don't respond to our user-defined health check &  doesn't advertise them to clients until they're 
	  ready to serve

7. Secret and Configuration Management:
	* Deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilidng our image and without exposing secrets in our
	  stack configuration

8. Horizontal scaling: 
	* Scale your application up and down with a simple command "with a UI/automatically" based on the CPU usage
