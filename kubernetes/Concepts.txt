Concepts:
* we use Kubernetes API Objects to describe our cluster's desired state like
	- what apps or workloads we wanna run
	- what container images they use
	- the number of replicas
	- what network and number of resources we want to make available and more
  We set our desired state by creating "Objects" using the "Kubernetes API", typically via the cli "kubectl"/"Kubernetes API" (lets us to interact directly with the Cluster to set/modify our cluster's desired state)
