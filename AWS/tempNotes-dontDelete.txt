Global Infrastructure:
* AWS Infrastructure is built around Regions & Availability Zones (AZs)
* A Region is a physical location where we have multiple AZs
* AZs consists of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity housed in separate facilities
* Each Region is completely isolated from others. But the AZs in a region are connected through low-latency links
* AWS provides us with the flexibility to place instances within multiple regions and multiple AZs within a region
* AZs are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

Security and Compliance:
* Security in the cloud is much like security in your on-premises data centers - only without the costs of maintaining facilities and hardware
* In the cloud, you dont have to manage physical servers or storage devices. Instead we use Software based security tools to monitor and protect
  the flow of information into and out of our Cloud resources
* AWS Cloud enables a shared responsibility model. As AWS is responsible for Security in the cloud, we are also equally responsible. This means 
  that you can retain control over the things what ever you want like you have on on-site data center
* In the AWS Environment, we can take advantage over of automated tools for asset inventory and privileged access reporting
  
  Benefits of AWS Security:
  * Keep your data safe
  * Meet compliance requirements (COmpliance-deformation when added more instances etc.,)
  * Save money
  * Scale quickly (grows with the AWS resources you use)


Amazon web services cloud platform: 
	AWS consists of many cloud services that can be tailored according to our business/organization needs. This section introduces the major
	services by category. The AWS services can be accessed in all the following ways
	1. AWS management console
	2. AWS Cli
	3. AWS SDKs (Software development Kits)
	
  Services:
  
  1. AWS management console:
		A simple and intuitive user interface to access and manage the Amazon web services. We can also use 'AWS Console Mobile app'
	 to quickly view resources on the go
	
  2. AWS Command line(AWS Cli):
		AWS Cli is a unified tool to manage your AWS Services. With just one tool to download and configure, we can control multiple AWS
		services from the command line and automate them through scripts
  
  3. SDKs:
		SDks are used by our applications with an API according to our Programming language or platform
		
  4.
