1. Github generated String based PR Number - At Present
   - Done: We need to get the Numerically highest release version. 
     ~ If "changetype" exists in the body, go to next lowest version "till you donot get the changetype in the body"
     ~ Once you dont get the changetype, then get the PR based on the commit SHA ID

   - Done: Get its Commit SHA ID
     - Get the tag
     - Run the commmand against the tag
       ~ git show <tag> -n 1 -q --format=%H


2. Based on the SHA Obtained, Get the PR (curl -u "praveenvaranasi:${github}" -X GET https://api.github.com/repos/praveenvaranasi/DevOps/pulls?state=closed)
   - https://api.github.com/repos/praveenvaranasi/DevOps/commits/<sha id>/pulls 
   - Now, Get the changetype of the releases which are "MERGED AND CLOSED" released after the PR Obtained from the Step 1
